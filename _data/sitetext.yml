    title: About Us
    subtitle: "Pow-dr is a B2B service provider that helps change energy demand profiles - at scale!"
    text: "**Our origins**: Greer, Zeynep, and Ralf began working together as academic researchers at Imperial College London and the London School of Economics and Political Science. We founded pow-dr after five years of conducting research into the technical feasibility of what has now become our product. We tested user interactions with the product's various features with the academic rigour of behavioural economic analysis.<br>  
<br>  
**Our inspiration**: Throughout our experience, we recognized the powerful possibility to enable our users to be rewarded for doing good, and most importantly to have true agency in the renewable energy transition and climate change mitigation.<br>  
<br>  
**Our mission**: We are enabling a near-term future in which the growing network of our users around the world--our pow-dr planet--eliminates the need for fossil fuel generation to back up renewable generation sources when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing."
